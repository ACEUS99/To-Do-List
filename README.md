**Note**
This was my first big project build. Everything from the design to the functioning of the website was planned out from the beginning to allow for an end goal to be established which would in-turn help me remain focussed on what tasks would need to be completed at each point of the build.

It was a very challenging buuld as I had to introduce new concepts that I had previously not explored, but my persistance coupled with research and video tutorials on YouTube aided the completition of the build. 

It works by having the user input a task via the input field at the top of the screen. Once they hit enter, it will display this on the screen and also save it to Google Firebase storage.
